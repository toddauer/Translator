'''
This program will convert plain text in a .txt file named "Translate" to a new file called "Translated".
Benefit of this program is that it goes around the 3k character limit on Google Translate and it saves the output to a document. 
Prevelant issue: It can be SLOW based on how many lines of text you are trying to translate.
